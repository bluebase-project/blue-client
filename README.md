# Blue Client

### About

Blue Client is a part of Blue Project, a base for poketibias servers. This is a client for usage with Blue Server. It aims to be complete and flexible,
for that it uses LUA scripting for all game interface functionality and configurations files with a syntax
similar to CSS for the client interface design. Blue Client works with a modular system, this means
that each functionality is a separated module, giving the possibility to users modify and customize
anything easily. Users can also create new mods and extend game interface for their own purposes.
Blue Client is written in C++20 and heavily scripted in lua.

For a server to connect to, you can build your own with the [blue-server](https://github.com/bluesrc/blue-server).
